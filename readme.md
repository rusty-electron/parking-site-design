# User Interface for Parking System Project

This site is complementary to the Parking System found [here][link]. This is a decent UI for a user to monitor the parking spaces at various available locations.

*This site is live [here](http://electronweb.000webhostapp.com/site/index.html).*

*More documentation will be added soon*.
